## 📬 Multi-Agent ACA Renewal Extraction

To pull referrals for every ACA Renewal Stomp agent (Daniel Berman, Jordan Gassner, Richard Odle, Carlos Varona, Miguel Garcia, Charlie Rios, Nick Salamanca), run the production extractor:

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Create a `.env` with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY`, plus any optional Drive/Slack settings
3. Place your Google OAuth desktop credentials in this folder as `credentials.json` (the script will create `token.json` on first auth)
4. Run:
   ```bash
   python extract_all_deals-properly-mcp.py --agent danielberman.ushealth@gmail.com --max 25
   ```
   * omit `--agent` to sweep every agent inbox in one pass
   * add `--auto-save` to push high-confidence leads into Supabase automatically
   * CSV exports land under `exports/`; raw attachments live in `attachments/<thread_id>/`

Repeat the command with different `--agent` emails to generate per-agent spreadsheets, or skip the flag for an “all-agents” sweep.
